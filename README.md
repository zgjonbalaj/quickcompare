# About

The goal of this project is to automate several tasks involved with Q&A during web development. Though many projects involve spec testing and automated workflows for those that do not the reliance in manually checking your work is heavy. In cases where the majority of your work involves stylesheets or rendering javascript or the testing is in the visuals this project aims to provide a bridge to automation for that.

By using open source tools such as phantomjs, casperjs and the potential to connect to a BrowserStack API this tool aims to create a semi-automatic workflow in ensuring your code changes do not affect rendering.  

# To DO

1. Implement a better URL checking method.
2. Streamline folder creation.
3. Update async code
4. Implement BrowserStack API.
5. Cleanup code.

Finally, we'd like to thank BrowserStack for supporting the project and providing us with API access during development to test our features and code. If you're in development and want to test your apps across different browsers and platforms as well be sure to check them out. They provide tools that make the majority of these processes simple, quick and efficient.
